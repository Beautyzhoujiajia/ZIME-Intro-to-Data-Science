import pandas as pd # by convention

# pandas is short for "panel data"
# it is built on top of numpy (is short for "numerical python")
# 2 main reasons to use pandas for data science
# 1. label-based indexing (in addition to position-based indexing)
# 2. really great builtin functionality for indexing, cleaning,
# computing statistics, etc.

# there are 2 main objects in pandas
# 1. Series: 1D data
# 2. DataFrame: 2D data

# let start with Series

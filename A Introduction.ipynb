According to [IEEE Spectrum](http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/software/the-2016-top-programming-languages), Python is a top 3 programming language of 2016 and according to [KDNuggets](http://www.kdnuggets.com/2014/08/four-main-languages-analytics-data-mining-data-science.html), Python is a top two programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (second only to R). \n",

    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",
